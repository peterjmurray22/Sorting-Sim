# Sorting-Sim
A simulator for a "ball-sorting" game like [this](https://sg.carousell.com/p/move-the-ball-focus-and-concentration-toy-145798062/).
The simulator runs by randomly moving balls from one side to the other until the balls are completely sorted.

The user may specify how many trials to run, whether the starting conditions are random or an "even split", and how many balls per color to use.
